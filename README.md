# SQL Marketing Data Analysis

This project aims to develop test attribution models to pinpoint which marketing and sales channels and segments generate the highest pipeline revenue. Using SQL, data from multiple sources were ingested, transformed, and mapped to enable detailed analysis. The process involved writing SQL queries to create essential tables, as well as performing data cleaning, normalization, and aggregation to construct various attribution systems, such as First Touch or Last Touch.
